"""The measured live-vs-precompute GATE (ADR-0054), adapted for ProspectMap's client-side lane.

ProspectMap runs its WofE/CI/logistic-regression/validation entirely IN THE BROWSER, a pure-TypeScript engine
(frontend/src/mpm/) plus the learned classifier + OOD autoencoder via onnxruntime-web. A case runs LIVE iff it is
client-side AND its runtimes are a subset of the deployed set AND a full recompute + its replay trace are within
budget; otherwise it is PRECOMPUTE and the SPA replays the committed trace. The WofE recompute over a teaching-scale
grid is milliseconds and the traces are small, so every case passes. The verdict + budgets go into the manifest; CI
fails on mislabeling. A MEASUREMENT, never a hand-wave."""
